# teeworlds-protocol
Documenting the teeworlds network protocol

https://chillerdragon.github.io/teeworlds-protocol/

## goals

- describe as much of the teeworlds 0.6/0.7 and ddnet protocol as possible.
- describe it as correct as possible.
- describe it with examples and with technical details.
- describe it as manual as possible (avoid uncorrectness caused by automation).
- do not depend on any tooling other than a web browser to get it up and running.
